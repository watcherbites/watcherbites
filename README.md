**BYI ( or after, if youre curious LMAO.. )**

i get nervous EASILY.. i sometimes struggle to initiate conversation with people, coming up to me or whispering to me is REALLY HELPFUL and ENCOURAGED! i LOVE talking to people and making new friends (ESPECIALLY HOMESTUCK ONES).. i LOVE c + h but i get nERVOUSS just walking up!! if you see me around and you wanna sit with me or vice versa just WHISPER (I MIGHT NOT SEE IT AT FIRST IF IM OFFTAB OR AFK THOUGH... BUT I WILL COME!)

i also struggle with low self esteem (gasp sound effect) but i TRY not to let that get in the way of making pals and interacting with people. i tend to overthink and overanylyze stuff sometimes, if theres something up, dont be afraid to tell me!! i CRAVE communication and im always open to hear some critisizm to help me improve!!!

also if i start like.. NAGGING almost in a way of asking how youre doing or if youre okay or constantly apologizing (i cant help it im canadian /silly) or asking "ARE YOU SURE??" all the time PLEASE be patient im just nervous and trying to be helpful OR looking for reassurance because i am wondering if youre upset at me,, IM TRYING NOT TO DO IT SO OFTEN!!

SOMETIMES WHEN IM WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE MY HUMOR GETS A LITTLE BIT DIRTY.. I APOLOGIZE, PLEASE TELL ME IF YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE!

**DNI :**

proshippers, darkshippers, problematic fellas, uhhh what else uhh,, MEAN PEOPLE... HMM people who are not nice to my friends and overly sexual strangers / NEW friends.. oh also ex proshippers and darkshippers are on thin ice along with people who were problematic in the past, but mostly ex pro and darkship it, i dont play about that shit NO SIREE..

**INT :**

HOMESTUCK FANS OHH YESS!! musical fans (i sure love a good showtune heh), UHH MY BUDDIES,, (EVEN IF WE DONT KNOW EACHOTHER THAT WELL YET OR SOMETHING I STILL WANNA INT WITH YOOU),, and uh I DONT REALLY KNOW, ILL COME BACK TO THIS LATER..

**OTHER STUFF?? :**

i am usually with my FRIENDS... my friends are NICE, they wont bite a swear.. if i am sitting with any of them and you wanna come around dont be afraid to, just let me greet you so they know that youre with me and they dont accidentally hide you.. GULP!
